In the context of regional integration and global warming, a regional currency designed from a child's perspective.

The design theme interweaves history with the future. Crafted from the perspective of children, this series employs vector illustrations to capture a child's vision of the nation and its rich cultural heritage. Above all, the Bank aims to harness this design as a medium to heighten environmental awareness for both the current and forthcoming generations.

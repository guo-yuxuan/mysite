Echoes and Absences is an immersive exhibition designed to explore the emotional connection people have with a liminal place, The New Steps in Edinburghâ€™s old town. The exhibition utilizes LiDAR technology to create an immersive environment that stimulates the senses and transports the user to a different world. The aim is to create an engaging and thought-provoking experience that leaves a lasting impression on the user and contributes to ongoing discussions around the use of technology in art and cultural experiences, as well as the concept of place and how it shapes our experiences and emotions.

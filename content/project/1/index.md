Echoes and Absences is an immersive exhibition designed to explore the emotional connection people have with a liminal place, The New Steps in Edinburghâ€™s old town. The exhibition utilizes LiDAR technology to create an immersive environment that stimulates the senses and transports the user to a different world. The aim is to create an engaging and thought-provoking experience that leaves a lasting impression on the user and contributes to ongoing discussions around the use of technology in art and cultural experiences, as well as the concept of place and how it shapes our experiences and emotions.

The project explores the boundaries of human perception to look into the existence of places and non-places outside the limits of our traditional senses. We want to unveil the material and immaterial experiences that develop in the process before collapsing into certain oblivion by taking into account the interaction between tangible components and abstract information in the siege of algorithmic computation. Through various methods of recording, rethinking, reshaping, remaking or remixing place, we seek to uncover the liminal, cultural, ecological, and industrial aspects of environments, whether they are speculative, fictitious, or factual, emotive, informative, or rhetorical.  


The learning outcomes of this project include methods for capturing spatial data, ways of presenting and interacting with spatial data, and critical discourse around space, aesthetic, narrative and culture.
